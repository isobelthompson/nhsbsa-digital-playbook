## What is data accessibility?  

Low numeracy affects half of the adults in the UK. About 1 in 20 people have dyscalculia in the UK. As a comparison, about 1 in 10 to 20 people have dyslexia. Many live with the limitations of not understanding numbers and the impact that has on everyday life, like managing money, arranging appointments, doing calculations and telling the time.  

Conditions that specifically relate to data include:  
- Dyscalculia  
- Low numeracy  
- Low data literacy  
  
Therefore, we need to deliver services which convey numbers plainly and in a way that is easy for everyone to understand.

## Best practice for data accessibility  
  
Our internal Content Design Standards state how we should be presenting data. Some things we can use to help our users include:
- remove unnecessary numbers - always try to round values up to a whole number, and get rid of decimal places unless it’s money
- leave lots of space, so that numbers don’t jump around so much on the screen for people with dyscalculia 
- involve people who struggle with numbers in the design process, from both within and outside the design team
- explain charts and the data involved (initially and throughout), to increase data literacy. Access to any calculations involved
- breakdown and simplify aspects where possible, suitable for all users
- highlight important aspects/takeaways
- put things into perspective using data visualisation principles
- remove jargon, simplifying language
- use a suitable font size:
* The body of the text should be size 12px. [Source][data 3] 
* 	Frutiger or Arial should be used as the font throughout the report. The core NHS font is Frutiger and the secondary font is Arial. [Source][data 4]  
- always follow the appropriate hierarchy of titles in a page, this helps users of a screen reader navigate content quickly and easily
