## Non-functional requirements  
  
As functional requirements define what a system should do; non-functional requirements describe how efficiently one should function.  
  
Non-functional requirements are just as important as functional requirements.  
  
And it is important to accurately identify and define these requirements to ensure that your product runs smoothly while providing a good user experience.  
  
Avoiding non-functional requirements can cause critical problems that may lead your product to fail.  
  
Non-functional requirements affect the usability of a system, and if implemented correctly provide a good user experience.

## Dashboard non-functional requirements  
  
The following are some of many factors to consider when building a data product, such as a dashboard or a report:
- Accessibility
- Accuracy
- Auditing
- Capacity
- Confidentiality 
- Error-handling
- Maintenance
- Performance
- Reliability
- Resilience
- Scalability
- Security
- Testing
- Usability  
  
  
### Operational requirements  
  
Operational requirements describe how well the system is performing.  
   
When we refer to operational requirements within non-functional requirements, we are talking about accessibility, confidentiality, integrity, safety, usability, security, availability, efficiency, reliability, and suitability.  
  
### Revision requirements  
  
Revision requirements define how quickly a system solves problems caused by unexpected errors and how efficiently high-priority features can bounce back.  
  
Maintainability, scalability, flexibility, verifiability, and modifiability are classified as revision requirements.  
  
### Transition requirements  
  
Transition requirements define the capacity of the system to accept its surrounding environment.  
  
The users who are involved in the management of a system are most likely to be concerned about them.  
  
These requirements include good reusability, installability, portability, and interoperability.

## Monitoring NFRs  
  
We can monitor Non-Functional Requirements in a number of ways and planning for these in the development of your data product:
- Linking in with the relevant teams when developing and rolling out your dashboard, e.g. security, architecture
- Following best practices; data storage, access privileges
- Following testing processes; functions, accessibility, figures
- In-built metrics such as monitoring loading times
- By collecting and monitoring feedback from users
- Ensuring data literacy when checking figures
- Process improvements and automating alerts
- Creating back-up plans and service wrappers
- Structured maintenance processes
- Ensuring the appropriate infrastructure is in place such as capacity and tooling
- Documentation of processes and of considerations taken within the dashboard development process
- Reusability and scalability planning of the product, minimising manual overhead
- Ensuring version control processes are in place
