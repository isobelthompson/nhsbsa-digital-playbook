## Primary colours  

See the [NHS Identity Guidelines Colours pages][pc 1] for more detail. 

### Background  
  
Use a plain background, NHS Grey 5 (#f0f4f5) should be used.  
NHS White (#ffffff) is used to make important information stand out and for alternating backgrounds, for example on the NHS website home page.

### Related variables  
NHS Blue (#005EB8) alongside NHS Light Blue (#41B6E6) is recommended for two variables. For related variables such as comparing adults and children across two groupings, a 50% tint if recommended. Meaning for each grouping, the colour will be consistent, with two tints.  

If you need to use tints of this palette and have a small number of tints needed, use either 25% or 50%. We recommend 50%. If tints do not pass contrast ratio checks and the visualisation is suitable (i.e. not a line graph), a border should be created to further enhance the colour.  

Otherwise, tints of 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% can be used. Any % value is accepted as long as it is visible, clear and accessible.  

Note: we only recommend outlining the bars when using tints of a palette, in general, bar outlines add unnecessary clutter. We outline all bars to maintain consistency.
