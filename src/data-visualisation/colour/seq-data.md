## Sequential data  
  
Sequential data is any sort of data where the order has some meaning. For example, age groups.  
  
When you are presenting sequential data, it is est to use a single hue, or small set of closely related hues.  
  
Sequential data should use NHS Blue (#005EB8) as our primary colour to be used. Lightness should follow from pale to dark, rather than alternating between hues. Colours should also progress in the direction a user would expect, for example, for a line chart tracking age groups over time, a lighter colour would be used to demonstration younger citizens, and a darker colour for older citizens.
